# BlackJack
Creating a Blackjack game from scratch using Python

The game consists of a single player vs. the dealer, and only a single deck is used.

I have followed the basic rules listed [here](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/b/Blackjack.htm#:~:text=Rules,king "Blackjack rules").

***
The player can:
1. Hit
2. Stand
3. Double
4. Split
5. Surrender

There's no _Insurance_.
